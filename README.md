# Shadow-Removal-from-Images-using-Deep-Learning
This research introduces a cascade U-Net architecture for shadow removal in computer vision. The architecture consists of two stages of U-Net networks. The first stage predicts shadow-free images using a U-Net trained with shadow images and their corresponding ground truth. The second stage refines the results using another U-Net network. Experimental evaluations show that the proposed approach achieves impressive performance in both qualitative and quantitative assessments, surpassing other state-of-the-art methods. The cascade U-Net architecture progressively learns and improves shadow removal by leveraging initial predictions and ground truth. Overall, it offers a promising solution to enhance image quality and interpretability.
